 * # Bank Account Kata - Scalable Architecture
 * 
 * This project implements a bank account kata with a focus on scalability and clean architecture.
 * 
 * ## Architecture Overview
 * 
 * The application is structured according to domain-driven design principles with a focus on
 * scalability and separation of concerns:
 * 
 * 1. **Domain Layer**
 *    - Core business logic and entities
 *    - Business rules and invariants
 *    - Domain services
 * 
 * 2. **Application Layer**
 *    - Orchestrates use cases
 *    - Coordinates between domain layer and infrastructure
 *    - DTOs for external communication
 * 
 * 3. **Infrastructure Layer**
 *    - Technical implementations
 *    - Repository implementations
 *    - External service adapters
 * 
 * ## Key Features
 * 
 * - **Deposit and Withdrawal**: Secure money operations with validation
 * - **Account Statement**: Detailed history of all account operations
 * - **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns for maintainability
 * - **Scalability**: Designed for future extension and high volume
 * 
 * ## Running the Application
 * 
 * To run the demo application:
 * 
 * ```
 * mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="bankkata.App"
 * ```
 * 
 * To run the tests:
 * 
 * ```
 * mvn test
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Scalability Features
 * 
 * The architecture supports:
 * 
 * 1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Domain logic is stateless and can be distributed
 * 2. **Extensibility**: New operation types can be added easily
 * 3. **Performance**: Optimized data structures and algorithms
 * 4. **Testability**: Components are designed for isolation testing
